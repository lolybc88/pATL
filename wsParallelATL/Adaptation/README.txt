This project contains:
1) an AML strategy that computes changes between 2 versions of the same metamodel (hereby 2 versions of the Petrinet metamodel). 
2) A HOT takes the changes and generates an adaptation transformation.
We encourage you to look at the demo. This shows how to execute the Adaptation project. 
To test the generated adaptation transformation over Petrinet models, use the flatt.launch config.
