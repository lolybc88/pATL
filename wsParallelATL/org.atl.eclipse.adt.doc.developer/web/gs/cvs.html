<h1>Team programming with CVS</h1>
<p>
When you have to work in a group of people, a good way to work with concurrent versions is to use CVS. Eclipse 
allows this by providing a CVS sharing. Lots of informations in this page can be also found in the <a href="
../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-60_team.htm">Eclipse  CVS help page</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="share"></a>Sharing a new project using CVS</h2>
<p>
To share a CVS repository, we recommend you to do this :
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go into the <em>CVS Repository Exploring</em> perspective, and create there a new repository location with
	these values to save it :
			<table class="center">
  				<tr class="top"><td>Variable</td><td>Value</td></tr>
  				<tr><td class="left">Host</td><td class="right">172.16.9.33</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Repository path</td><td class="right">/var/lib/cvs</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">User</td><td class="right">&lt;your username&gt;</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Password</td><td class="right">&lt;your password&gt;</td></tr>
			</table>
	</li>
	<li>Create a simple project using the usual Eclipse new project wizard ;</li>
	<li>The next step is to share the project. To do so, right click on the project, and select <em>Team &gt; 
	Share project</em> ;</li>
	<li>You could now use the repository location created before to share your project ;</li>
	<li>Now you need to specify which module name to use. Because if you tell to Eclipse to use the project name,
it will create a bad directory on the CVS, and this is not a good idea ! Fill the gap using the path as on the CVS 
(org.atl.eclipse/adt/editor) instead of the project ID or name (org.atl.eclipse.adt.editor). Go <a href="#viewcvs">
here</a> to know how to access the CVS online ;</li>
	<li>The next page shows you which tag you could synchronize. Nothing has to be done here, but clicking on the
"Next" button will cause an error pop up. <em>You have to get this error</em>. Exit from the error, and cancel the 
panel. The synchronization needs an other step ;</li>
	<li>To import from the CVS, right click on the project, choose <em>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</em>. 
	The box of your project should be checked, and only it. Now click on <em>Finish</em>. An information pops up 
	and shows you some statistics. The first time you synchronize your project, you will probably have some 
	conflicts. Go <a href="#conflicts">here</a> to understand what to do in this case. Once this step is done, you 
	could update all incoming changes with the button on the top ;</li>
	<li>At last, you may need to ignore some files or directories. You can view <a href="#ignore">here</a> how to 
	do that.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The information pop up are a good way to be sure you do not make any mistakes. Do not hide them.
</p>

<h2><a name="icons"></a>Meaning of CVS icons</h2>
<p>
When you use a CVS repository, icons in the package explorer will change of look ! To understand the meaning of
each icons, you have to go to the <a href="../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-cvs-decorations.
htm">CVS Label Decorations</a> documentation page which will show that explicitly.
</p>

<h2><a name="conflicts"></a>Resolving conflicts</h2>
<p>
Lot of people is able to use a file at the same moment ! This will cause a conflict during the synchronization. 
Three cases could be considered :
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You do not mind of your version : thus you should update your date from the CVS ;</li>
	<li>Your data are safe and you are sure you have to upgrade files on the CVS, then you commit your changes ;
	</li>
	<li>You do not know what to do, or you are not sure of you may intend on the CVS, so you have to speak with 
	the team which will tell you what you may do !</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the first time you catch a project on the CVS, the procedure we encourage you to follow creates a new 
project with a simple file ".project" at the root. This file is an error for the CVS project, thus you need to 
update (import) and not the commit (export) this file. You cannot just update a conflicting file, so you have to 
override and update it. Do so by a right click on the file, and choose <em>Override and update</em>.</li>
</p>

<h2><a name="ignore"></a>Ignoring files</h2>
<p>
In the CVS update and commit procedures, you may ommit some files or directories. This is simply done in the <em>
Team Synchronization</em> perspective with a right click on the file and choose "Add to .cvsignore". The default 
option proposed is not so bad...
</p>
<p>
For example, the first time to catch a CVS project, a "bin" directory is locally created, and should not be 
exported to the CVS. Thus you can add it to the ".cvsignore" file. After this, the file ".cvsignore" will be 
created, and you can also repeat the procedure with this file.
</p>

<h2><a name="viewcvs"></a>Accessing the CVS online</h2>
<p>
A CVS has the particularity to be a directory tree accessible online. In fact this is possible through Perl 
scripts which one is linked <a href="http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/private/viewcvs.cgi/">here</a>. 
Our CVS is password-protected, so you need to enter the &lt;username&gt; and the &lt;password&gt; of the site.
