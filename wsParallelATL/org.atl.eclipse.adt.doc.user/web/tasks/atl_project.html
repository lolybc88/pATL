About ATL project 
</h1>
<h2>
Creating a new ATL project
</h2>
<p>
ATL defines its own project kind.<br/>
You can create a new ATL project by doing as follows :<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Select File > New > Project from the menu bar ;</li>
	<li>Select ATL Project in the ATL folder ;</li>
	<li>Fill in all the requested information.</li>
</ul>
Then a file with name made up of the transformation name and extension "atl" would have been created.
The ATL icon should decorate the file name. Double clicking on the file name will open an editor and display
its associated outline in the eclipse outline view.
</p>
<h2>
Building an ATL project
</h2>
<p>
When an ATL project is created it is automatically associated the ATL builder. Then building an ATL project becomes
quite literal.<br/>
Two possibilies are offered to carry out a build, either <b>automatically</b> or <b>manually</b> :

<ul>
	<li>
	Automatically means typically when a resource of the project is saved. To do so, only select Window > Preferences from the menu bar 
	and in the Workbench sub menu (on the left) tick the checkbox "Perform build automatically on resource modification" ;
	</li>
	<li>
	Manually means that the build can be performed by selecting Project > Build Project.
	</li>
</ul>

Note that the build will be carried out only if the project has changed since last build. A project is considered to have changed if one 
of the resource its contains has changed and changes have been saved. Note also that the "Build project" item, located in the menu bar, will be activated
only if the focus is put on the ATL project (in the navigator view).
<br/>
Another way to perform manual build, that would be preferred by users, is to right click on the project and select "Build Project". 
<br/>
It should pointed out that when building an ATL project, <b>only files that have been changed since last build will be compiled</b>.
An ATL file is considered to have changed if it has been saved since its last compilation.
