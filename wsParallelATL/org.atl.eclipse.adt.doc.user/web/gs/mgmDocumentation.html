	   <h1>Using Megamodel Tool</h1>
      <p>The plugin org.atl.eclipse.mgm manages projectors (injectors and extractors).</p>

<p>Initially, only XMLInjector, ATLInjector and XMLExtractor are available.</p>

<p>To use these projectors (and after the installation of plugin org.atl.eclipse.mgm), you should open the view called Megamodel Resource Navigator (Window --> Show view --> Other --> ATL --> Megamodel Resource Navigator). This view is similar to Default Resource Navigator.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On XML file, in the context menu, you should launch action called: "Inject XML file to XML model"</li>
	<li>On ATL file, in the context menu, you should launch action called: "Inject ATL-0.2 file to ATL-0.2 model"</li>
	<li>On XML model (for the moment only on Ecore file), in the context menu, you should launch action called: "Extract XML model to XML file"</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Be careful, for Extraction action the checking of conformance relation (Model conforms to a Metamodel) is not done. If you launch action "Extract XML model to XML file" on a Ecore file which is not a XML model, an empty file is generated.</b></p>
