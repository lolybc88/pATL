<h1> Debugging your programs</h1>
<p>
In this section, you will learn more about debugging ATL transformations in the workbench. In debug mode, execution may be suspended and resumed, breapoints added, and you can see the variables of the stackframes.</p>
<p>For debuging, switch to the Debug perspective. This perspective has been designed for the action "Debug".<br>
<br>
In order to debug your ATL transformation, use the drop-down Debug menu in the toolbar and select "Debug...". This will open the Launch Configurations dialog. A launch configuration allows you to configure how a program is launched, including its arguments, and other options. <br>
There are two types of launch configuration : ATL configuration and Remote ATL configuration. The last is useful when you want to launch the debugger out of Eclipse (for example, if your transformation needs injector or extractor, the ATL configuration cannot be used but with Remote ATL configuration it's possible). Otherwise, you can use the ATL configuration when you have a project with input and output models, input and output metamodels, it's easier to use than remote ATL configuration.
</p>
<p>See <a href="../reference/ATL_configuration.html">ATL configuration</a> or <a href="../reference/remote_ATL_configuration.html">Remote ATL
configuration</a> pages to know more about the creation of launch configuration.</p>
<p>When your ATL configuration is finished, you can debug the ATL transformation (Button "Debug" in ATL Configuration).</p>
<p>There is several important views in the debug perspective.</p>

<h2>The Debug view</h2>
<p>
<img src="../img/debugView.png" alt=""><br></p>
<p>In this view, you see the different configurations launched with their state. For each configuration, there is the debug target, threads and stackframes.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the transformation is suspended. If you click on resume button in button view, it will run until the breakpoint is reached. When the breakpoint is hit, execution is suspended. Notice that the process is still active (not terminated) in the Debug view.<br> To step through the code, click the <strong>Step Over</strong> button.&nbsp; Execution will continue at the next line in the same method (or, if you are at the end of a method, it will continue in the method from which the current method was called).<br> Try some other step buttons (<strong>Step Into, Step Return) </strong>to step through the code.&nbsp; Note the differences in stepping techniques.<br>
You can end a debugging session by allowing the program to run to completion or by terminating it.<br> You can continue to step over the code with the <strong>Step </strong>buttons until the program completes.<br> You can click the&nbsp; <strong>Resume </strong>button to allow the program to run until the next breakpoint is encountered or until the program is completed.<br>
You can select <strong>Terminate</strong> from the context menu of the program's process in the Debug view to terminate the program.<br>
<br>
When an exception arrived, you can see it on the debug view. The exception is displayed in thread line, just after the state.<br></p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="../../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-51.htm">Debug view</a> page.</p>
<h2>The editor view</h2>
<p><img src="../img/editorView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 954px; height: 359px;"><br></p>
<p>In the editor view, you can see the code being debugged, the breapoint. On each step, you see the highlighted text changed.</p>

<h2>The variable view</h2>
(See JDT reference <a href="../../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-74.htm">Variable view</a>)
<p><img src="../img/variableView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 639px; height: 291px;"></p>
<p>The Variable view displays the values of the variables in the selected stack frame. You can expand the tree in the Variables view. The variables in the Variable view will change when you step in the Debug view.</p>
<p><img src="../img/expandVariableView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 520px; height: 649px;"></p>

<h2>The Outline view</h2>
<img src="../img/outlineView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 318px; height: 359px;"><img src="../img/expandOutlineView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 321px; height: 358px;">
<p>See <a href="../reference/outline_view.html">Outline View</a> page to have more information on outline view.</p>
<p>To sum up, to put a breakpoint expand the tree and select the wanted element. Make a right click and choose "add breakpoint" in the context menu.</p>

<h2>The breakpoint view</h2>
<p>(See JDT reference <a href="../../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-35.htm">Breakpoint view</a>)</p>
<p><img src="../img/breakpointView.png" title="" alt="" style="width: 636px; height: 293px;"></p>
<p>The Breakpoints view lists all the breakpoints you have set in the workbench projects. You can double-click a breakpoint to display its location in the editor. In this view, you can also enable or disable breakpoints, delete them, or add new ones.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>When terminated state appears in the debug view, the transformation has finished its work. Now, you can create another launch configuration.</p>
<p>As you can see, the ATL debugger in Eclipse is like the Java debugger. More informations can be found in the Java Development User Guide, see <a href="../../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-13.htm">Debugging your programs (for Java Application)</a>.</p>
